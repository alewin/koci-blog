Hi, I'm Alessio, a Web developer from Bologna, where I graduated in Computer Science. At the moment I'm mainly working in the Javascript world, but I'm also interested in learning Backend, DevOps and Data engineering notions.

The goal behind writing this blog is to motivate myself to learn new things and, above all, to share what I have learned with others.
