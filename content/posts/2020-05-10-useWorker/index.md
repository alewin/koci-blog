Three months ago, I started to write my first Open Source **React Hook**: [useWorker](https://github.com/alewin/useWorker).
A simple library that allows you to use WebWorker easily with React Hook.

Wait wait wait...

# What is Web Worker?

**Web worker** is a Web API, that allows running tasks in the background threads, without impacting the single call stack of the main thread!.

Since JavaScript is a **single-threaded** programming language it can run only one task at a time.


![call stack](images/callstack.png)

The main thread has a **single call stack**, based on the LIFO principle (Last-in-first-out), and it's responsible to draw DOM elements, parsing code, listen and react to events, etc.. so one heavy task can **block** or slowing the execution of the entire application.


# How works Web Worker?
Web worker has own EventLoop with their Call Stack and communicate with the main thread using a system of messages.

### System of messages

The pattern consists of two methods: `postMessage` and `onmessage`, these methods enables cross-origin communication between the main thread, pop-ups, iframes, or webWorkers:

- `postMessage` allows send messages from __main thread__ to __worker__ and vice versa

**MainScript.js**
```javascript
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage('Hi');

worker.onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log(`Message received from worker: ${e.data}`) // e.data = 'Hi main thread, I'm the worker.js'
}
```

- `onmessage` allows to recive a message from __worker__ to __main thread__ and vice versa

**Worker.js**
```javascript
onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log(`Message received from main thread: ${e.data}`); // e.data = 'Hi'

  postMessage(`Hi main thread, I'm the worker.js`);
}

```

Using this system message pattern, the main thread can delegate heavy tasks to a web worker.

## React supports Web Worker?
Yes and no... The official way to create a new react project is: [Creat React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
a tool from react-core-team that gives you a preconfigured WebPack and Babel configuration so you can focus on the code, and not on the configuration.

Since **CRA** offers you a **pre-configured WebPack config**, the main problem is to customize the configuration with a custom plugin such
[WorkerLoader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/worker-loader/), and edit the generated output bundle.


**Example**
```md
Input files: `worker.js`, `main.js`, `homepage.jsx`, `profile.jsx`
React Output bundle using CRA: `output.js`
```

The problem is that we only have `output.js` and not the individual files (`worker.js`) needed by WebWorker API

```javascript
const worker = new Worker("worker.js"); // We cannn't import worker.js :(
worker.postMessage('Hi');
```

This is present since 2016:

![https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1277](images/abramov-issue.png)

There are others open `issues`  on Github but a solution has not yet been found: [#1277](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1277), [#3660](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3660)


`useWorker` with a workaround make possible and easier run webWorker **without costumizing** the configuration, and continue to use CRA.

## How "useWorker" bring it possible?

The ingredients for this recipe are:
- [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/it/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise): API to support asynchronous operations.
- [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob): Object that collects raw data that can be read as text or binary.
- [Url.createObjectURL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL) : Function that return an URL that reference the contents of o `File` or `Blob`

As we were saying before to use the WebWorker native API you need to create a file with the worker content, and then import it in the main thread.

```javascript
const worker = new Worker('workerFile.js`)
```

We will aim to simulate the creation of a `workerFile.js` dynamically so we can run our WebWorker using a `Blob`

```javascript
const worker = new Worker('blob://3j4f-3n3f-3fn3kf3-fsv`)
```


First of all, let's convert the function inside `workerFile.js` to a `string` so that we can save it inside a` Blob` ( Yes it's insane but it is true! )

**workerFile.js**
```javascript
function sortNumbers(nums) {
  return nums.sort();
}
```

We will therefore have:

```javascript
const code = `function sortNumbers(nums) { return nums.sort(); }`
```

In order to return a `Promise` we must call the `sortNumbers` inside a `Promise` and convert everything back into a string

```javascript
const code = `return Promise(function sortNumbers(nums) { return nums.sort(); }).then(()=> postMessage(result))`
```

Now we need to find a way to inject the function's parameters every time it is called

```javascript
const blobCode = `return Promise(function sortNumbers(nums) { return nums.sort(); }).then(()=> postMessage(result))`
```

The last step is to convert everything into a URL

```javascript
const blob = new Blob([blobCode], { type: 'text/javascript' })
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
```

In this way we could finally call the webworker dynamically

```javascript
const worker = new Worker('blob://3j4f-3n3f-3fn3kf3-fsv`)
```

The API of `useWorker` to facilitate the operation of calling the worker and receiving the response, uses hooks, ensuring a very simple and clean final result


```javascript
const [sortWorker] = useWorker(sortNumbers);
const result = await sortWorker(numbers); // non-blocking UI
```


# What limitation have WebWorker?

Anche se WebWorker permettono di delegare operazioni pesanti ad un'altro thread, lo svantaggio principale Ã¨ dovuto dalla lentezza
nel trasferire i dati attraverso `postMessage`.

...



# Then should I use the web worker for anything?, what are Web Worker for?
No, you should use it everywhere, WebWorkers should be used only for tasks that blocking the UI, or for intense CPU task.

Some use cases:
- Analyze the audio or video sources
- Processing, manipulating, filtering large Array, JSON, or Object
- Canvas graphic processing
- CSV generation or zip compression
- Heavy math calculation
- Real-time text highlighting, formatting, linting, Spell checking
- Background polling system
- Any intense CPU task, that could block UI


# Can I see an example?

Sure!

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useWorker } from "@koale/useworker";

const numbers = [...Array(5000000)].map(e => ~~(Math.random() * 1000000));
const sortNumbers = nums => nums.sort();

const Example = () => {
  const [sortWorker] = useWorker(sortNumbers);

  const runSort = async () => {
    const result = await sortWorker(numbers); // non-blocking UI
    console.log("End.");
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={runSort}>
      Run Sort
    </button>
  );
};
```
