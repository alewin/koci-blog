- Organize menu by **macro-categories**.
- Use a relevant text and **minimal** description providing **answers** to questions with a legible **font sizes** (16px+).
- **Encourage** users to view offers and content, showing previous searches, and **Pre-fill** current location, Add **urgency**.


**DON'T**

- **Don’t** use full page **interstitials** on homepage
- **Don’t** use automatic **carousels** ( prefer User-initiated scrolling )
- **Don’t** use long descriptions without a value for the user

# Form UX Tips

The forms allow you to collect user data, try to make them clear, intuitive and simple to fill in

**DO:**

- Use real-time inline **validation** and **autofill** ( prefill Zip Code )
- Use correct input type ( keypads, text )
- Group fields into one ( use full name instead of first/last )
- Use pagination or a progress bar if more than 2 steps in conversion flow
- To build trust, clarify why specific information is needed
