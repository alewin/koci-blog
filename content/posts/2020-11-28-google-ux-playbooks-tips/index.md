## Intro

Last year I came across some "secret" Google documents about UX concepts. I took notes while reading these PDFs, and wrote an article about them, writing about best practices (part 1) and real case studies described in the documents.

There are 8 "UX Playbokos":

- [üõçÔ∏è Retail](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/retail.pdf)
- [üí∞ Finance](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/finance.pdf)
- [üöò Automobile](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/auto.pdf)
- [‚úàÔ∏è Travel](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/travel.pdf)
- [üèòÔ∏è Real Estate](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/realestate.pdf)
- [üíâHealthcare](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/healthcare.pdf)
- [üß≤ Lead Gen](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/leadgen.pdf)
- [üì∞ News and content](https://github.com/alewin/google-ux-playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/news.pdf)

I will not analyze them individually since they are well done with numerous explanatory slides, but I will try to make a general summary.

## 1) UX Common Best Practices

### 1.1 Homepage UX Tips

The homepage is the main page of the site and must be the entry point for all its features, Highlight the main CTA of your site, and leave secondary information in a menu.

**DO:**

- Ensure key **calls to action** appear at the top of **every page**.
- Prioritize CTA via **color**, contrast, size with a **descriptive text**.
- Organize the menu by **macro-categories**.
- Use a relevant text and **minimal** description providing **answers** to questions with a legible **font sizes** (16px+).
- **Encourage** users to view offers and content, showing previous searches, and **Pre-fill** current location, Add **urgency**.


**DON'T**

- **Don‚Äôt** use full page **interstitials** on homepage
- **Don‚Äôt** use automatic **carousels** ( prefer User-initiated scrolling )
- **Don‚Äôt** use long descriptions without a value for the user

**Example:**

### 1.2 Form UX Tips

The forms allow you to collect user data, try to make them clear, intuitive and simple to fill in.

**DO:**

- Mark **required** fields with an **asterisk** 
- Use real-time inline **validation** and **autofill** ( prefill Zip Code )
- Use correct input type ( keypads, text )
- Group fields into one ( use full name instead of first/last )
- Use pagination or a progress bar if more than 2 steps in conversion flow
- To build trust, clarify why specific information is needed

**DON'T**

- **Don‚Äôt** use too many fields (remove optional fields, use full name instead of first/last, hide company and address line 2 by default, hide billing by default) 
- **Don‚Äôt** use dropdowns for inputs with < 4 options, instead opt for buttons

**Example:**

### 1.3 Conversion Flow UX Tips

Induce potential users to continue to progress through the various stages of the conversion funnel, reducing churning at each stage of the funnel and increasing your product's value for your customer.

**DO:**

- Display a value prop at every stage of the funnel (example If calls are important, prompt calling at every stage of the funnel ).
- Use pagination to guide the user if more than 2 steps in conversion flow.
- Use social proof for trust (Trust Pilot, Visa Badge, trust signals..).
- Upsell during the conversion flow ( coupon, recommended products, etc..).
- Support cross-device action by emailing or saving for later, or checkout as a guest.
- Add urgency elements (4 users are viewing this item, Only 3 pieces available ).
- Have descriptive CTAs

**DON'T**

- **Don‚Äôt** use too many exit points during conversion ( reduce menu, remove links etc..).
- **Don‚Äôt** redirect into checkout after adding to cart.

**Example:**

### 1.4 Search UX Tips

‚ÄúSearch is a defining element of the user experience‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, it‚Äôs also the source of endless frustration. Search is the worst usability problem on the Web.‚Äù [cit. Peter Moville and Jeffrey Callendar]

**DO:**

- Make search visible at all times.
- Use auto-suggestions, and implement spelling correction.
- Display number of search results.
- Include a Search History of latest property results.

**DON'T**

- **Don‚Äôt** show an empty search result page ( propose content even if the search has no results)
