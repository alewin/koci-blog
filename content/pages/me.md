Hi, I'm Alessio, Web developer, from Bologna, where I graduated in computer science.
At the moment I work mainly in the Javascript world, but I find interesting integrate my knowledge by learning also Backend, DevOps, Data engineering notions.

The goal of this blog is to encourage me to learn and especially to share what I have learned.
